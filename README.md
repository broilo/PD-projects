### (1) *"Proton-proton forward scattering at the LHC"*

Published in Published in: Phys.Lett.B 799 (2019) 135047

DOI: 10.1016/j.physletb.2019.135047

Abstract: Recently the TOTEM experiment at the LHC has released measurements at s = 13 TeV of the proton-proton total cross section, σ tot , and the ratio of the real to imaginary parts of the forward elastic amplitude, ρ . Since then an intense debate on the C -parity asymptotic nature of the scattering amplitude
was initiated. We examine the proton-proton and the antiproton-proton forward data above 10 GeV in the context of an eikonal QCD-based model, where nonperturbative effects are readily included via a QCD effective charge. We show that, despite an overall satisfactory description of the forward data is
obtained by a model in which the scattering amplitude is dominated by only crossing-even elastic terms, there is evidence that √ the introduction of a crossing-odd term may improve the agreement with the measurements of ρ at s = 13 TeV. In the Regge language the dominant even(odd)-under-crossing object
is the so called Pomeron (Odderon).

### (2) *"Forward elastic scattering and Pomeron models"*

Published in Eur.Phys.J.C 79 (2019) 12, 1033

DOI: 10.1140/epjc/s10052-019-7545-2

Abstract: Recent data from LHC13 by the TOTEM Collaboration indicate an unexpected decrease in the value of the ρ parameter and a σ tot value in agreement with the trend of previous measurements at 7 and 8 TeV. These data at 13 TeV are not simultaneously described by the predictions from Pomeron models selected by the
COMPETE Collaboration but show agreement with the maximal Odderon dominance, as recently demonstrated by Martynov and Nicolescu. Here, we present a detailed analysis on the applicability of Pomeron dominance by means of a general class of forward scattering amplitude, consisting of even-under-crossing leading contributions associated with single, double, and triple poles in the complex angular momentum plane and subleading even and odd Regge contributions. The analytic connection between σ tot and ρ is obtained by means of singly subtracted dispersion relations, and we carry out fits to pp and p̄p data in the interval 5 GeV–13 TeV. The data set comprises all the accelerator data below 7 TeV, and we consider two independent ensembles by adding either only the TOTEM data or the TOTEM and ATLAS data at the LHC energy region. In the data reductions to each ensemble, the uncertainty regions are evaluated with both one and two standard deviations (∼68% and ∼95% CL, respectively). Besides the general analytic model, we investigate four particular cases of interest, three of them typical of outstanding
models in the literature. We conclude that, within the experimental and theoretical uncertainties and both ensembles, the general model and three particular cases are not able to describe the σ tot and ρ data at 13 TeV simultaneously. However, if the discrepancies between the TOTEM and ATLAS data are not resolved,
one Pomeron model, associated with double and triple poles and with only 7 free parameters, seems not to be excluded by the complete set of experimental information presently available.

### (3) *"Model of diffractive excitation in pp collisions at high energies"*

Published in the PHYSICAL REVIEW D 101, 074034 (2020)

DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.101.074034.

Abstract: A phenomenological model for the description of the single and double diffractive excitation in pp collisions at high energies is presented. Considering the Good-Walker approach, we propose a model for the eigenstates of the scattering operator and for the treatment of the interaction between them, with the high energy behavior of the cross section driven by perturbative QCD. The behavior of the total, elastic, single, and double diffractive cross sections are analyzed and predictions for the energies of Run 3 of the LHC and those of the cosmic rays experiments are derived. We demonstrate that the model describes the current data for the energy dependence of the cross sections. A comparison with the recent data for the ρ parameter and the differential elastic cross section are also presented and shortcomings of the current model are discussed.

### (4) *"Investigating the impact of the partonic structure on the description of hadronic collisions at high energies"*

Published in Int.J.Mod.Phys.A 35 (2020) 22, 2050127

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1142/S0217751X20501274

Abstract: The impact of the partonic structure on the description of the hadronic cross sections is investi-gated considering a multi-channel eikonal model based on the Good – Walker approach. The total,elastic and single diffractive cross sections are estimated considering different parametrizations forthe parton distribution functions and the predictions are compared with the experimental datafor proton-proton (pp) and antiproton-proton ( ̄pp) collisions. We show that the description of thehigh-energy behavior of the hadronic cross sections is sensitive to the partonic structure.
