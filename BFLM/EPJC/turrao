Comments to the Author
Authors consider the possibility to describe the available (at \sqrt(s)>10 GeV and/or > 5 GeV)
forward data on \sigma_{tot} and \rho=Re/Im ratio within the QCD inspired model which includes 
the minijet production and the 'soft' component but do not have the Odderon contribution. 
For the QCD part they use three different sets of parton distributions and get in each case a 
rather good results. However each time the tension with the TOTEM 13 TeV data was observed.
The model gives sigma_{tot} a bit smaller and \rho a bit larger than the values claimed by TOTEM.
This may indicate the necessity to include a C-odd (Odderon) high energy amplitude.

I recommend the publication of EPJC-19-10-080 manuscript but after the revision.

1. sect 4,A -- we can not use 4 TOTEM 8 TeV values of \sigma_{tot} shown in Table I as an independent 
data points with their error bars (the same for 2 TOTEM points at 13 TeV). These values were extracted 
from the same set of d\sigma_{el}/dt data. Either author have to choose the best (from their point of 
view) result or to include all four 8 TeV points keeping the correct statistical weight; that is they have
to enlarge twice (\sqrt(4)) the error bars for each point."

Reviewer #1: Recent TOTEM and ATLAS/ALFA data on total pp cross  sections at 7 and 8 TeV plus
the TOTEM data on Re/Im ratio were included into the fit of elastic scattering amplitude in order 
to check the consistency of these data with the lower energy measurements and to improve accuracy 
of the high energy predictions.

This is an interesting study and I recommend the publication of the manuscript but
not in its present form. The revision is needed.

1. We can not consider different TOTEM points, such as $\sigma_{tot}=101.5 and 101.9$  
or 102.9 and 103.0 at 8 TeV and, may  be (this is not so clear), 98.6, 98.0 and 99.1 at 7 TeV) 
as the statistically independent  results. Actually this were a bit different analysis of the 
same data set. I would include such points into the fit with a lower statistical weight, say, 
50% for  101.5 and 101.9 or 102.9 and 103.0 pairs.
